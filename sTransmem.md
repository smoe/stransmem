# Soluble Variants of Transmembrane Proteins #

This project addresses the bioinformatics support for the investigation of soluble variants of integral membrane proteins. Data from this project was previousl published as

Steffen Möller, Eilhard Mix, Martin Blüggel, Pablo Serrano-Fernández, Dirk Koczan, Vasilis Kotsikoris, Manfred Kunz, Michael Watson, Jens Pahnke, Harald Illges, Michael Kreutzer, Stefan Mikkat, Hans-Jürgen Thiesen, Michael O. Glocker, Uwe K. Zettl and Saleh M. Ibrahim "Collection of soluble variants of membrane proteins for transcriptomics and proteomics"
In Silico Biology 5, 0028 (2005)

which is freely accessible [here](http://www.bioinfo.de/isb/2005/05/0028/).

Today we have moved away from the previous motivation which was on helping protomics labs to make better sense of their data and think more about possible routes towards predictors of soluble variants.
